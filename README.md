# Slowbooks Pro 2026

**A personal bookkeeping application "decompiled" from the ashes of QuickBooks 2003 Pro.**

Free and open source. Runs on Linux and Windows. No Intuit activation servers required.

## The Story

I ran QuickBooks 2003 Pro for 14 years for side business invoicing and bookkeeping. Then the hard drive died. Intuit's activation servers have been dead since ~2017, so the software can't be reinstalled. The license I paid for is worthless.

So I built my own replacement. Every invoice I ever printed is getting re-entered from paper copies.

The codebase is annotated with "decompilation" comments referencing `QBW32.EXE` offsets, Btrieve table layouts, and MFC class names — a tribute to the software that served me well for 14 years before its maker decided it should stop working.

**This is a clean-room reimplementation.** No Intuit source code was available or used.

## Features

### Invoicing & Payments
- **Invoices** — Create, edit, duplicate, void, mark as sent. Auto-numbering, auto due-date from terms, dynamic line items with running totals. Print/PDF generation via WeasyPrint
- **Estimates** — Full estimate workflow with convert-to-invoice (deep-copies all fields and line items)
- **Payments** — Record payments with allocation across multiple invoices. Auto-updates invoice balances and status (draft/sent/partial/paid)
- **Quick Entry Mode** — Batch invoice entry for paper invoice backlog. Save & Next (Ctrl+Enter) with running log of created invoices

### Double-Entry Accounting
- **Journal Entries** — Every invoice and payment automatically creates balanced journal entries (DR A/R, CR Income per line, CR Sales Tax). Void creates reversing entries
- **Chart of Accounts** — 39 seeded accounts (Contractor template), 6 account types (asset, liability, equity, income, COGS, expense)
- **Account Balances** — Updated in real-time as transactions post

### Banking
- **Bank Accounts** — Register view with deposits and withdrawals
- **Bank Reconciliation** — Full workflow: enter statement balance, toggle cleared items, validate difference = $0, complete

### Contacts & Items
- **Customer & Vendor Management** — Full contact info, billing/shipping addresses, terms, credit limits
- **Items & Services** — Product, service, material, and labor types with default rates and linked income/expense accounts

### Reports
- **Profit & Loss** — Income vs expenses for any date range
- **Balance Sheet** — Assets, liabilities, and equity
- **A/R Aging** — Outstanding receivables grouped by customer with 30/60/90 day buckets
- **Sales Tax** — Tax collected by invoice with taxable/non-taxable breakdowns
- **General Ledger** — All journal entries grouped by account with debit/credit totals
- **Income by Customer** — Sales totals per customer with invoice counts
- **Customer Statements** — PDF statement with invoice/payment history and running balance

### Company Settings
- Company name, address, phone, email, tax ID
- Default terms, tax rate, invoice/estimate numbering
- Default invoice notes and footer text

### UI
- Authentic QB2003 "Default Blue" skin with navy/gold color palette
- Splash screen with build info and decompilation provenance
- Windows XP-era toolbar, sidebar navigator with icons, status bar
- Global search bar (searches customers and invoices live)
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Alt+N` (new invoice), `Alt+P` (payment), `Alt+Q` (quick entry), `Alt+H` (home), `Ctrl+K` (search), `Escape` (close modal)
- No frameworks — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS single-page app
- Dashboard with receivables, overdue count, recent invoices/payments, bank balances

### QuickBooks 2003 Pro Interoperability
- **IIF Export** — Export all Slowbooks data (accounts, customers, vendors, items, invoices, payments, estimates) as .iif files importable into QB2003 via File > Utilities > Import > IIF Files
- **IIF Import** — Parse and import .iif files exported from QB2003 with duplicate detection and per-row error handling
- **Validation** — Pre-flight validation of .iif files before import (checks structure, account types, balanced transactions)
- **Date Range Filtering** — Export invoices and payments for specific date ranges
- **Round-Trip Safe** — Export from Slowbooks, re-import into Slowbooks — deduplication prevents double-entry

### Utilities
- **Backup Script** — `scripts/backup.sh` — pg_dump with gzip compression, keeps last 30 backups
- **IRS Mock Data** — `scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py` — Seeds realistic test data from IRS Publication 583 (Henry Brown's Auto Body Shop: 8 customers, 13 vendors, 10 invoices, 5 payments, 3 estimates)
