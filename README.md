## The Story

I ran QuickBooks 2003 Pro for 14 years for side business invoicing and bookkeeping. Then the hard drive died. Intuit's activation servers have been dead since ~2017, so the software can't be reinstalled. The license I paid for is worthless.

So I built my own replacement. Every invoice I ever printed is getting re-entered from paper copies.

The codebase is annotated with "decompilation" comments referencing `QBW32.EXE` offsets, Btrieve table layouts, and MFC class names — a tribute to the software that served me well for 14 years before its maker decided it should stop working.

**This is a clean-room reimplementation.** No Intuit source code was available or used.

- **Batch Payments** — Apply payments to multiple invoices across multiple customers in a single transaction
- **Credit Memos** — Issue credits against customers, apply to invoices to reduce balance due. Proper reversing journal entries

- **AP Aging Report** — Outstanding payables grouped by vendor with 30/60/90 day buckets

### Double-Entry Accounting

- **Pay Runs** — Create pay runs with automatic withholding calculations: Federal (progressive brackets), State (5% flat), Social Security (6.2%), Medicare (1.45%)
- **Process Payroll** — Creates journal entries: DR Wage Expense, CR Federal Withholding, CR State Withholding, CR SS Payable, CR Medicare Payable, CR Bank
- Tax calculations are approximate — disclaimer included. Verify with a tax professional

### Banking
- **Bank Accounts** — Register view with deposits and withdrawals
- **Bank Reconciliation** — Full workflow: enter statement balance, toggle cleared items, validate difference = $0, complete
- **OFX/QFX Import** — Import bank transactions from OFX/QFX files with FITID dedup, preview before import, auto-match by amount/date

### Reports & Tax
- **QuickBooks-style period selector** — All reports support preset periods (This Month, This Quarter, This/Last Year, Year to Date, Custom Date) with live refresh
- **Profit & Loss** — Income vs expenses for any date range
- **Balance Sheet** — Assets, liabilities, and equity as of any date
- **A/R Aging** — Outstanding receivables grouped by customer with 30/60/90 day buckets
- **A/P Aging** — Outstanding payables grouped by vendor with 30/60/90 day buckets

### Dashboard
- Company Snapshot with Total Receivables, Overdue Invoices, Active Customers, Total Payables
- **AR Aging Bar Chart** — Color-coded stacked bar (Current/30/60/90+ days)
- **Monthly Revenue Trend** — Bar chart showing last 12 months of invoiced revenue
- Recent invoices and payments tables
- Bank balances at a glance

### Communication & Export

- **CSV Import/Export** — Import/export customers, vendors, items, invoices, and chart of accounts as CSV
- **Print-Optimized PDF** — Enhanced invoice PDF template with company logo support
- **IIF Import/Export** — Full QuickBooks 2003 Pro interoperability (see below)

### System & Administration
- **Dark Mode** — Toggle between QB2003 Blue theme and dark mode (Alt+D or toolbar button). Persists in localStorage
- **Backup/Restore** — Create and download PostgreSQL backups from the settings page
- **Multi-Company** — Support for multiple company databases, switchable from UI
- **Global Search** — Unified server-side search across customers, vendors, items, invoices, estimates, and payments

### UI
- Authentic QB2003 "Default Blue" skin with navy/gold color palette (+ dark mode)
- Splash screen with build info and decompilation provenance
- Windows XP-era toolbar, sidebar navigator with icons, status bar
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Alt+N` (new invoice), `Alt+P` (payment), `Alt+Q` (quick entry), `Alt+H` (home), `Alt+D` (dark mode), `Ctrl+S` (save modal form), `Ctrl+K` (search), `Escape` (close modal)
- No frameworks — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS single-page app
- 25 SPA routes, 24 sidebar nav links

### QuickBooks 2003 Pro Interoperability
- **IIF Export** — Export all Slowbooks data (accounts, customers, vendors, items, invoices, payments, estimates) as .iif files importable into QB2003 via File > Utilities > Import > IIF Files
- **IIF Import** — Parse and import .iif files exported from QB2003 with duplicate detection and per-row error handling
- **Validation** — Pre-flight validation of .iif files before import (checks structure, account types, balanced transactions)
- **Date Range Filtering** — Export invoices and payments for specific date ranges
- **Round-Trip Safe** — Export from Slowbooks, re-import into Slowbooks — deduplication prevents double-entry

### Utilities
- **Backup Script** — `scripts/backup.sh` — pg_dump with gzip compression, keeps last 30 backups
- **Recurring Invoice Cron** — `scripts/run_recurring.py` — Standalone script for generating due recurring invoices
- **IRS Mock Data** — `scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py` — Seeds realistic test data from IRS Publication 583 (Henry Brown's Auto Body Shop: 8 customers, 13 vendors, 10 invoices, 5 payments, 3 estimates)

sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE bookkeeper OWNER bookkeeper"

cp .env.example .env
alembic upgrade head
python3 scripts/seed_database.py
python3 run.py

## QuickBooks 2003 Pro — IIF Interoperability

Slowbooks can exchange data with QuickBooks 2003 Pro via **Intuit Interchange Format (IIF)** — a tab-delimited text format that QB2003 uses for file-based import/export.

![QuickBooks Interop Page](screenshots/iif-interop.png)

### Exporting from Slowbooks to QB2003

1. Navigate to **QuickBooks Interop** in the sidebar
2. Click **Export All Data** (or export individual sections)
3. For invoices/payments, optionally set a date range
4. Save the `.iif` file
5. In QuickBooks 2003: **File > Utilities > Import > IIF Files** and select the file

**What gets exported:**

| Section | IIF Header | Fields |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Chart of Accounts | `!ACCNT` | Name, type (BANK/AR/AP/INC/EXP/EQUITY/COGS/etc.), number, description |
| Customers | `!CUST` | Name, company, address, phone, email, terms, tax ID |
| Vendors | `!VEND` | Name, address, phone, email, terms, tax ID |
| Items | `!INVITEM` | Name, type (SERV/PART/OTHC), description, rate, income account |
| Invoices | `!TRNS/!SPL` | Customer, date, line items, amounts, tax, terms |
| Payments | `!TRNS/!SPL` | Customer, date, amount, deposit account, invoice allocation |
| Estimates | `!TRNS/!SPL` | Customer, date, line items (non-posting) |

### Importing from QB2003 to Slowbooks

1. In QuickBooks 2003: **File > Utilities > Export > Lists to IIF Files**
2. In Slowbooks: navigate to **QuickBooks Interop**
3. Drag and drop the `.iif` file (or click to browse)
4. Click **Validate** — checks structure, account types, and balanced transactions
5. If validation passes, click **Import**

The importer handles:
- Automatic account type mapping (QB's 14 types → Slowbooks' 6 types)
- Parent:Child colon-separated account names
- Duplicate detection (skips records that already exist by name or document number)
- Per-row error collection (a bad row won't abort the entire import)
- Windows-1252 and UTF-8 encoded files

### IIF Format Reference

IIF is tab-delimited with `\r\n` line endings. Header rows start with `!`. Transaction blocks use `TRNS`/`SPL`/`ENDTRNS` grouping. Sign convention: TRNS amount is positive (debit), SPL amounts are negative (credits), and they must sum to zero.

```
!TRNS	TRNSTYPE	DATE	ACCNT	NAME	AMOUNT	DOCNUM
!SPL	TRNSTYPE	DATE	ACCNT	NAME	AMOUNT	DOCNUM
!ENDTRNS
TRNS	INVOICE	01/15/2026	Accounts Receivable	John E. Marks	444.96	2001
SPL	INVOICE	01/15/2026	Service Income	John E. Marks	-438.00	2001
SPL	INVOICE	01/15/2026	Sales Tax Payable	John E. Marks	-6.96	2001
ENDTRNS
```

### Account Type Mapping

| Slowbooks Type | IIF Types (by account number range) |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Asset | `BANK` (1000-1099), `AR` (1100), `OCASSET` (1101-1499), `FIXASSET` (1500-1999) |
| Liability | `AP` (2000), `OCLIAB` (2001-2499), `LTLIAB` (2500+) |
| Equity | `EQUITY` |
| Income | `INC` |
| Expense | `EXP` |
| COGS | `COGS` |

### Sample Data

The `scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py` script populates Slowbooks with test data from **IRS Publication 583** (Rev. December 2024) — "Starting a Business and Keeping Records." The sample business is **Henry Brown's Auto Body Shop**, a sole proprietorship with:

- 8 customers (John E. Marks, Patricia Davis, Robert Garcia, Thompson & Sons, etc.)
- 13 vendors from the IRS check disbursements journal (Auto Parts Inc., ABC Auto Paint, Baker's Fender Co., etc.)
- 8 service/material items (Body Repair, Paint & Finish, Dent Removal, Frame Alignment, etc.)
- 10 invoices totaling $3,631.31 with 1.59% sales tax
- 5 payments totaling $1,498.00
- 3 pending estimates
- All with proper double-entry journal entries

```bash
python3 scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py
```
